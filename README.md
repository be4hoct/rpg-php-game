# rpg-php-game
Trying to build an RPG game in PHP with no coding skills.
## concepts
- different races.
- different classes. Pretty standard - melee (physical combat), mage (magic skills), dextirity/evasion (bow and dagger).
- different skills. An unique skill for each race.
- different armors and weapons
- rarity of the items - common, rare, legendary. Item stats should increase with rarity.
- HP and MP potions
- obtaining items and potions through quests and grinding.
- increasing levels through quests and grinding.
